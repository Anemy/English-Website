	<p class="page-text">
		But first, <span style="">what is Javascript?</span>
		<br>
		Javascript is a programming langauge designed for use in one's web browser.
		<br>
		Here's an example:
	</p>

	<div class="javascriptButtonWrap">
		<button onclick="exampleButtonClicked()" class="javascript-example-button">
			Click me!
		</button> 
	</div>

	<div class="click-counter">
		0 Clicks
	</div>

	<p class="page-text">
		<br>
		Javascript makes web pages dynamic and interactive for the user.
		<br>
		<canvas id="myCanvas" width="300" height="200" style="border:1px solid #d3d3d3;">
			Your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas tag.</canvas>

		<br>
		<a href="/main.js" target="_blank"><span style="{color:blue;}:hover{cursor:pointer;}">Want to see the code?</span></a>
		<br>
		Recently, however, Javascript has started to make a pull outside of then web browser.
		<br>
		In 2009 Node.js was released.
		<br>

		<br>
		Node.js enables Javascript on the serverside. This framework allows developers to develop in just one langauge if they so choose, Javascript.
		<br>
		<a href="http://tagpro.gg/"><span style="{color:blue;}:hover{cursor:pointer;}">http://tagpro.gg</span></a> is a great example of a game which is written entirely in Javascript, clientside and serverside.
		<br>
		Node.js introduced the notion that Javascript can be used for more than just purpose.
		<br>
		Javascript began popping up in a slew of new locations.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h1 class="page-heading"><a href="https://www.leapmotion.com">Leap Motion</a></h1>
		<img src="http://www.lessonlogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/LeapMotion.jpg" width="400"/>
		<br>
		A sensor hardware called Leap Motion uses a Javascript API for communication. The Leap Motion measures distances above of it. Javascript is used to control the receptors on the Leap Motion. This is actual hardware which Javascript is controlling. Through tools like the Leap Motion, Javascript is moving into a role of a programming language across platforms, outside of the web browser.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h1 class="page-heading"><a href="http://pijs.io">pijs.io</a></h1>
		pijs.io is another great example of how Javascript can be easily harnessed across platforms. pijs.io is a Javascript framework that enables programmers to interface directly with a Raspberry PI, a fairly basic computer. This means Javascript is being used to maintain system calls in a machine.
		<br>
		<br>
		With these current trends in widespread usage of Javascript, the future will bring about even more Javascript utility.
		<br>
		An interesting metric provided by the code repository hosting site GitHub, shows the amount of repositories that have programs written in Javascript overtime:
		<br>
		<h1 class="page-heading"><a href="http://githut.info/">http://githut.info/</a></h1>
		<br>
		With this information one can see the scaling graph related to Javascript's adoption overtime and how it is ever growing.
		Frameworks such as node.js and the APIs provided by Leap Motion and pijs.io show that Javascript has a purpose outside of the web browser that is ever growing and will continue to influence more fields and become more universal in time.
